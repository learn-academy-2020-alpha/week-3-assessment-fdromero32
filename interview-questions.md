# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destruction is putting the desired key values that are available in our state object and writing them as a variable so that we do not need to include "this.state" in front of the key value everytime we use them in our methods/functions. 

  Researched answer: Itâ€™s a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets into their own variable. It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time. This saves us, the programmer time by not having to write out the variables (which could be very long) every single time.

2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: .map can accept (value, index, and ___)

  Researched answer: .map can accept (currentValue, index, arr).
          - currentValue === current value of the current element
          - index === index value fo the current element
          - array === the array object the current element belongs to

3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint which creates as many objects as we desire. 
  An object is a set of key value pairs which contains information that can be drawn at a later time. 

  Researched answer: Object is an instance of class. Class is the blueprint. 
  Object would be a real world entity whereas Class is a group of similiar objects. 
  Object is created many times as required. Class is declared once. Objects allocated memory when created, Class does not.

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: A div encapsulates multiple different tags within it. A span tag would be quivalent to a <p> tag and would be used for enclosing text information, not other tags. 

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: React.Fragment is the shorthand version to write an enclosing div in your return(). 
  
  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

  Researched answer: 1) Media Query CSS rules. 2) Using Bootstrap (grid view) 3)Using the Viewport (meta tag that scales browser screen size)
